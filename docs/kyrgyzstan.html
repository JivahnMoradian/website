          I visited Kyrgyzstan in August 2023, as part of my Central Asia trip with my good friend from university Allen
          Liu. We took a 4-hour bus from Almaty (Kazakhstan) across the border to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan’s capital city.
          Like most other countries in Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan is very safe, and we met several solo women travelers
          who confirmed that impression. Although getting into Kyrgyzstan was easy, getting out proved challenging. When
          we arrived at the Bishkek bus station to buy a ticket for Uzbekistan, we learned that all buses were filled up
          for the next 24 hours, so we had to delay our departure until the next day. The following day, we were running
          late for our bus, so we ordered a taxi using Yandex (a Russian app like Uber, but sooo much cheaper). Our
          driver was pulled over by the police, delaying us even further. Somehow, we caught our bus with under 5
          minutes to spare.

        <h2>Bishkek</h2>
        <p>
          Bishkek is a pleasant city to explore, but not one with a lot of touristic activities. We spent two days
          here, and I feel confident that one could easily get a good taste of the city within a day. Bishkek’s
          architecture feels Soviet in style, and it has a good number of parks and greenery, which made strolling
          around refreshing. I was surprised to notice that the city became much more vibrant at night, and many people
          were strolling around the park in the evening. Allen and I checked out the Osh Bazaar near the city center
          hoping to buy some souvenirs, but it turns out that almost no one at the market was selling touristic
          trinkets. Instead, they sold mundane items like food and clothing. What nerve these local merchants have to
          cater to local Kyrgyz residents instead of clueless American tourists!

          The region that is now Kyrgyzstan has fallen under the rule of many different empires. It was controlled by
          the Mongols until the 18th century, then it was taken over by the Chinese Qing dynasty and by the Uzbek Kokand
          Khanate. By 1876, Kyrgyzstan fell under the control of the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution of
          1917, Kyrgyzstan was incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. Many Kyrgyz
          people resisted the Soviet push for collective agriculture and rapid industrialization because it conflicted
          with their traditional nomadic way of life. Although Kyrgyzstan is a very poor country with a GDP per capita
          of less than $2,000, it had better infrastructure than I would have expected, along with a decent life
          expectancy of 72 years and a literacy rate of almost 100%. So perhaps the Soviet influence had some benefits.

          Kyrgyzstan is by far the most democratic country in Central Asia. Unlike its neighbors, whose history since
          independence has been dominated by one or two authoritarian leaders, Kyrgyzstan has had 6 presidents since
          1991, including the region’s first female head of state. Nonetheless, Kyrgyzstan’s democracy is far from
          perfect. In 2005, many Kyrgyz people believed that Askar Akayev (the nation’s first president) was corrupt and
          becoming dictatorial. They overthrew him in what became known as the Tulip Revolution. Similar revolutions in
          2010 and in 2020 also ousted Kurmanbek Bakiyev and Sooronbay Jeenbekov, Kyrgyzstan’s second and fifth
          presidents respectively. Although its democracy is far from perfect, I find it admirable that this small
          nation keeps such a vocal opposition. However, many people accuse the current president Sadyr Japarov of
          corruption, nepotism, and of democratic backsliding. Only time will tell where Kyrgyzstan’s political system
          will end up.

        <h2>Ala Archa National Park</h2>
        <p>
          We went on a day trip to Ala Archa National Park in the Tian Shan mountains that are less than an hour’s drive
          away from Bishkek. We opted to hike up to the Racek Hut, in a 6-hour roundtrip journey. We passed by a
          stunning valley, and even a herd of wild horses. At the hut, we took a break and enjoyed the magnificent views
          of the peaks around us. The mountains in Kyrgyzstan are massive – Ala Archa Park contains several that are
          higher than any in Europe or in the contiguous United States, and Kyrgyzstan’s highest peak is a stunning
          7,400m / 24,400ft high. We considered hiking further, but an incoming thunderstorm made us turn around without
          any regrets.

        <h2>Ala-Too Square and Manas Statue</h2>
        <p>
          The Ala-Too Square marks the center of Bishkek. When Kyrgyzstan was part of the USSR, it was called Lenin
          Square and sported a large statue of Vladimir Lenin. After Kyrgyzstan gained its independence in 1991, they
          changed the square name and replaced the statue of Lenin with one of the Kyrgyz folk hero Manas. Poor Lenin
          was demoted to a less prominent location nearby. I think that swapping out a Soviet hero for a Kyrgyz one is a
          way for the country to reclaim its history and cultural heritage. In the back of the square, you can make out
          the Kyrgyz State Historical Museum, which boasts exhibits on traditional Kyrgyz customs and historical
          milestones.

      As a Central Asian post-Soviet state, I expected Kyrgyzstan to have very few traces of Western influence. I
      was therefore shocked to see cinemas advertizing the Barbie movie. We could not pass up the opportunity to
      watch Barbie in Kyrgyzstan, so we went to the cinema - and even got to see it in English! This made me realize
      that American media culture really is widespread across the world.
