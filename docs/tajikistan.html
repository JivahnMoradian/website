          I visited Tajikistan in August 2023, as part of my Central Asia trip with Allen Liu, a good friend from
          university. We took a taxi from Samarkand (Uzbekistan) to the border, walked across, and took another taxi on
          the Tajik side to the city of Panjakent. I am quite sure we witnessed two separate instances of bribery in the
          first hour – I think a man slipped some money to a border agent at the border, and our taxi driver was pulled
          aside by a cop and handed him some money while talking with him outside the car. The highlight of our trip was
          trekking in the Fann Mountains.

          Tajikistan’s transportation infrastructure is atrocious. I learned that until recently, the road connecting
          Khujand and Panjakent in the country's northwest with Dushanbe became impassible during the winter, so the
          only way to get from one part of the country to the other was via Uzbekistan. In 2006, Iranian engineers built
          the Anzob tunnel that solved this problem. However, this tunnel was nicknamed the “Tunnel of Death” because it
          initially lacked any lighting or ventilation, so if your car breaks down in the tunnel you could straight up
          die from carbon monoxide poisoning. By the time we traversed the tunnel, the Iranian engineers had fortunately
          solved the ventilation issue, though the concept of “light” remained foreign to them.

        <h2>Dushanbe and Panjakent</h2>
        <p>
          Dushanbe is Tajikistan’s capital and largest city. It is a planned city that appears quite modern, though it
          retains many historic buildings as well. It is quite lively, and cheap as well – Allen found us $3 cocktails
          that were the best alcoholic drink I have ever tasted! We explored Dushanbe’s national museum, and I
          particularly appreciated the exhibit they had on Zoroastrianism (my religion). Even though Tajikistan is
          almost entirely Muslim, the Tajik people still take pride in their pre-Islamic heritage. Panjakent is a city
          on Tajikistan’s western border with Uzbekistan. It is right next to the ruins of the ancient city of Sarazm.
          Panjakent has a massive bazaar that we explored to get provisions for our backpacking trek – because we did
          not see the usual packaged foods that Americans usually eat on intense hikes, we bought several bags of nuts,
          dried fruit, and a massive circular loaf of local bread.

          Tajikistan’s history resembles that of many other countries in Central Asia. It was ruled successively by the
          Mongol Empire, the Timurid Empire, and the Khanate of Bukhara, before it was conquered by the Russian Empire
          in the late 19th century. Although Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek are all in the Turkic language family, Tajik is
          essentially a dialect of Persian that is very similar to Afghanistan’s Dari language. Similarly, the Tajik
          people are ethnically related to Iranians. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Tajikistan joined the
          Soviet Union as the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In part due to its mountainous and remote
          location, Tajikistan was the poorest of the Soviet republics, and sadly retains that title today.

          Tajikistan gained independence from the USSR in 1991. However, the lack of a strong national identity,
          economic struggles, and cultural tensions led to the Tajikistani Civil War, which lasted from 1992 until 1997.
          The Tajik government was supported by Russia and was pitted against the United Tajik Opposition, a wide
          coalition of liberal and Islamist groups based largely in the nation’s remote Eastern provinces. This war
          devastated Tajikistan’s economy and infrastructure, and displaced over a million people. Although a ceasefire
          was reached, Tajikistan’s leadership did not change, as Emomali Rahmon has remained its president continually
          since 1994. Rahmon heads an authoritarian regime and has been accused of nepotism – his son is the mayor of
          Dushanbe and the chair of Tajikistan’s National Assembly. It was fascinating to see a real-time cult of
          personality – posters of Rahmon’s imposing and scowling face were plastered all around Dushanbe and Panjakent.

        <h2>Fann Mountains and Chimtarga Pass</h2>
        <p>
          The most exciting part of our trip was hiking to Chimtarga Pass, a 4,750m high pass between two gargantuan
          peaks in Western Tajikistan’s Fann mountain range. The trek involved a total of 17,000ft / 5,200m elevation
          gain, and covered 31 miles / 50km. We had to take a taxi from Panjakent to the isolated mountain town of
          Artuch, where we rented sleeping bags and a tent. Thus began one of the most beautiful hikes I have ever done.
          We passed by 3 scintillating alpine lakes, which contrasted well with the grey and beige mountains. The few
          hikers we crossed were mainly Russian, but for the most part we had the landscape to ourselves. The night sky
          was so clear that we could make out the Milky Way even when the Moon brightened the sky. We camped at Mutiny
          Lake (elevation 3,500m). The streams leading into the lake proved to be sumptuous sources of water that we
          filtered.

          The final stretch to Chimtarga Pass was challenging. Sleeping at such a high elevation without great
          acclimatization left Allen and me both drowsy and light-headed. However, the more we hiked, the better we
          felt. After some steep uphill that involved navigating loose rock and even some snow, we made it to the pass
          without any major issues. Because we were a bit ahead of schedule, we managed to make it all the way down to
          the beautiful blue Alauddin Lake. Eager to get back, we woke up at 2am to night hike the final stretch back to
          Artuch. I had hoped to proudly and gracefully stride towards the basecamp to show the Russian and Tajik
          residents what Americans are capable of. Unfortunately, I slipped in a pool of mud just before arriving, and
          the hues of murky brown that had embedded themselves in my pants made it look like I had soiled myself. Which
          I suppose I had in the most literal sense possible. It took us exactly 52 hours to complete the hike.

        <h2>Ismail Somoni Statue</h2>
        <p>
          Just as Uzbekistan seems to worship Amir Timur, Tajikistan venerates Ismail Somoni. The nation’s currency and
          tallest mountain are named after him, and I saw multiple statues of him in both Dushanbe and Panjakent.
          Between 892 and 907 AD, Somoni united the Samanid Empire, which had previously been split between multiple
          rulers, and both fortified and brought stability to the city of Bukhara (now in modern-day Uzbekistan). Somoni
          extended the Samanid Empire’s borders, and though he was still officially subordinate to the Abbasid
          Caliphate, his military prowess and diplomacy allowed his to operate as a de facto independent state. This
          revitalized Persian culture, language, and influence in the region.
