          <h2>Belgrade</h2>
          <p>Belgrade (or Beograd as it is called in Serbian) is the capital city of Serbia. It is located at the intersection of the Danube and the Sava rivers, making it an important strategic location. Belgrade used to be the capital of Yugoslavia, which was a country that included the present-day nations of Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, and North Macedonia. These provinces all shared a common Slavic identity, but were home to a large number of ethno-religious groups that had long histories of struggling against one another. In the Balkans, religion is tied to ethnicity: Serbs, Montenegrins, and Macedonians are Orthodox Christians, Croats and Slovenes are Catholic, and Bosnians and Albanians (from both Albania and Kosovo) are Muslims.</p>

          <p>Under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslavia was a communist country during the Cold War from 1947 to 1991, but refused to align itself with the Soviet Union. This unsurprisingly caused tensions between the two nations. Although many people describe Tito as a dictator, a large number of people in post-Yugoslav countries still view him positively. I could not help but admire his boldness when I learned that after surviving numerous assassination attempts by the USSR, he sent a letter to Stalin himself saying "Stop sending people to kill me. If you do not stop sending killers, I will send one to Moscow, and I will not need to send a second." Tito led Yugoslavia until his death in 1980. My Bosnian friend and I tried to visit Tito's tomb, and arrived at his mausoleum 15 minutes before it closed. However, the museum staff had already closed the ticket registration system, and simply could not allow us to enter. This was a shame, but, as my Bosnian friend pointed out, was also a free glimpse into the marvels of Yugoslav/Serbian bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>After Tito's death, ethnic tensions began to rise in Yugoslavia, which ultimately resulted in its breakup during the 1990s. The Yugoslav state, under the leadership of president Slobodan Milosevic, was reluctant to let its constituent republics leave. This led to a series of wars and conflicts, including the Bosnian genocide. In 1999, Yugoslavia attempted to remove ethnic Albanians from the region of Kosovo. In retaliation, NATO forces bombed Belgrade, which caused damage to a lot of the city's infrastructure, and destroyed the prominant Avala Tower on the outskirts of the city (which has since been rebuilt). I did not notice any damages when I visited, however, which makes me think that they did a good job of refurbishing the city. Milosevic would later be arrested and charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>

          <h2>National Museum of Serbia</h2>
          <p>The National Museum of Serbia is located in the central Republic Square. It has housed a wide variety of art from around Europe, as well as more distant locations such as Japan, since 1950. The Prince Mihailo Monument stands right in front of the museum. Built in 1882, this statue commemorates a 19th century Serbian prince.</p>

          <h2>Military Museum</h2>
          <p>Like many European cities, Belgrade has a fortress within its city limits. Unlike most European cities, inside Belgrade Fortress is the Military Museum, which displays an impressive selection of weaponry and war machines, from ancient times until the Cold War. I was surprised that the modern machinery included a mixture of both Soviet and American tanks and planes. I learned that because Yugoslavia was a non-aligned country, it was able to acquire weapons from both the USA and the USSR. As a consequence, it built up one of the strongest armies in Europe, which no doubt contributed to its ability to remain independent of both world superpowers.</p>

          <h2>Church of Saint Sava</h2>
          <p>Relatively humble on the outside, the Church of Saint Sava is impressively ornate on the inside. It is named after a 12th century Serbian monk and prince nicknamed the "Enlightener" who had a significant influence on Serbian culture, literature, and law. It is also one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world. I was astonished to learn just how long this church took to be built. Although the construction of the church was started in 1935, this was stalled during World War II following the Axis occupation of Belgrade. After the war, Yugoslavia's communist government prevented further construction of the church for over 30 years in an attempt to downplay the importance of religion in everyday life. This was in part to keep the country united, as historic tensions between its sizeable Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim populations were at constant risk of reigniting. The church's construction was once again put on hold during the NATO bombing of Belgrade in 1999. Most of the church was finally completed by 2004. Given that the church is perhaps the most beautiful one I have ever been in, I think it was well worth this century-long wait.</p>
