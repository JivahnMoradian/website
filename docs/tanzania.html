          I visited Tanzania in June 2024, as part of my East Africa trip with my good college friend Allen Liu. We took
          a 10-hour shared taxi from Nairobi to Moshi, a city near the Kenyan border on the base of Kilimanjaro. The big
          highlight of our trip was climbing up this majestic mountain. We then took yet another bus to Dar Es Salaam,
          the largest city. Tanzanian transport operates on what the locals call “Tanzanian Flexible Time” –your bus
          will eventually reach its destination, but this could occur anytime between now and next Tuesday. Although
          Allen is ethnically Chinese, and I am White-passing, multiple people had difficulty telling us apart. I
          suppose that if one is not used to seeing many foreigners, all Asians and White people look alike!

        <h2>Dar Es Salaam and Zanzibar</h2>
        <p>
          Dar Es Salaam is Tanzania’s largest city and business hub. Allen and I were fortunate to have an
          Indian-Tanzanian friend who grew up in Dar Es Salaam, who connected us with a family friend of his who
          generously showed us around the city and took us to one of the less crowded beaches. Although Dar Es Salaam is
          very multicultural, I noticed that there is a clear stratification between the wealthier White and Indian
          people, and the poorer Black people. One of the highlights of the city was exploring the Village Museum, which
          exhibits traditional huts and housing from many of Tanzania's numerous ethnic groups. Zanzibar is an island in
          the Indian Ocean that is a 1.5-hour ferry ride from Dar. It is much more touristic, and its historic Stone
          Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

          Tanzania’s position on the Indian Ocean has made it an important hub for trade for centuries. It was colonized
          by Germany during the 1880s, and would remain known as German East Africa until 1920, when Germany ceded it to
          Britain following its defeat in World War I. It was then called Tanganyika. It remained under British control
          until it gained its independence in 1961. In 1964, Tanganyika united with Zanzibar (which used to be a
          separate country) to become Tanzania.

        <p>
          Between 1961 and 1985, Tanzania was led by Julius Nyerere, a popular leader who devised a socialist policy
          called Ujamaa, which focused on self-reliance of local communities. He also promoted the use of Swahili, which
          helped unite Tanzania’s diverse population. These policies helped Tanzania develop in many areas, including
          healthcare and education. However, its economy stagnated during Nyerere’s rule. Since Nyerere resigned in
          1985, power has democratically changed hands five times, and Tanzania has been one of the most stable and
          peaceful countries in the region. Nonetheless, all of Tanzania’s leaders since independence belong to the same
          political party, and the people I met consistently said that corruption is a major problem.

        <h2>Kilimanjaro Trek</h2>
        <p>
          Kilimanjaro is the highest free-standing mountain in the world. It does not require any technical skills to
          climb. Nonetheless, it took us 5 days to complete because the distance is massive, and we had to move slowly
          to acclimatize to the high elevation (5,895m / 19,340ft at the peak). You are required to hire a guide to
          climb Kilimanjaro, and the cheapest option we could find was $1,900. It turns out that in Tanzania, this gets
          you what is essentially a luxury tour of the mountain. We had a 9-person team of porters and guides accompany
          us and cook us 3 gargantuan meals each day. We enjoyed learning about life in Tanzania from our guide, Lazaro,
          during our ascent. On day 2, we crossed the cloud layer, and the view from above of the endless sea of clouds
          was mesmerizing.

        <h2>Kilimanjaro Summit</h2>
        <p>
          On day 4, we started the hike to the summit at 12:30am. Although not technical, it was incredibly steep. I
          suffered from moderate elevation sickness. I fortunately did not feel nausea, but my brain felt like it was
          operating at 60% capacity, and I was dizzy. The view of the night sky was stunning (even if the pictures show
          more color than we could see with the naked eye), and inspired me to keep on walking. We reached the summit at
          6:30am sharp, just as the sun was rising. The snow on the summit was hard to distinguish from the white sea of
          clouds below, making for an idyllic picture. Kilimanjaro’s summit is called Uhuru Peak, which means freedom.
          Our guide told us this commemorates Tanzania’s freedom from British colonial rule. The journey down from the
          summit went much faster than the way up.

        <h2>St Joseph's Cathedral (Zanzibar)</h2>
        <p>
          This Roman Catholic Cathedral is right in the center of Zanzibar's Stone Town. It was built in the 1890s by
          French missionaries. Although Zanzibar is almost entirely Muslim, it has a surprising number of churches. I
          was shocked to learn that Zanzibar was a hub of the Indian Ocean slave trade. Starting in the 18th century,
          Zanzibar was controlled by the Omani Empire, which evolved into the Zanzibar Sultanate. They captured
          thousands of Bantu people from nearby East African regions, and sold them to Arabs in the Middle East, and
          even as far away as India and China. At the end of the 19th century, as the British Empire gained power, it
          pressured the Sultanate into stopping the slave trade. I find it ironic that a nation that instigated the
          Transatlantic slave trade would be responsible for the Indian Ocean slave trade’s downfall.
