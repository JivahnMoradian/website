          <h2>My Services</h2>
          <p>I have over 6 years of experience teaching high school and unversity students. My specialities are math, statistics, economics, finance, and related business subjects; that being said, I also have experience tutoring SAT/ACT prep, Python, science, English, French, and public speaking. In addition, I enjoy teaching larger classes: I gave several geopolitics lectures at Princeton Global Youth Leaders in Shenzhen (China), taught math, science, and history at the Antar Bharati Balgram School in Lonavla (India), and have led countless study sessions for my peers in my undergraduate and masters programs.</p>

          <h2>My Tutoring Philosophy and Core Values</h2>
          <p>Although I strive to tailor my teaching style to the specific needs of my student, here are some of the key values that I hold myself to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Honesty: I value integrity above all else.</li>
            <li>Passion: Teaching is a passion for me, and not just a job. I will go out of my way and will take whatever time is necessary to help my students succeed.</li>
            <li>Efficiency: I strive to keep my lessons professional and efficient, while simultaneously adopting a lighthearted sense of humor to make them enjoyable and memorable.</li>
            <li>Rigor: I help my students understand the fundamental assumptions, logic, and background information necessary to progress.</li>
            <li>Empowerment: I help my students become independent learners, and measure my success by how quickly my students take their studies into their own hands.</li>
            <li>Vision: In addition to helping my students ace exams, I introduce them to the course contentâ€™s real-world applications.</li>
          </ul>
