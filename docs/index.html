          <h2><a href="index.html">Jivahn Moradian</a></h2>
          <p>I am a startup project manager, teacher, and adventurer who wants to help make the world more informed, interconnected, and tolerant. I grew up in India and in France with an American mother and an Indian father. After completing the intensive French scientific baccalaureate examinations, I studied economics at Princeton University in the USA for my bachelor's degree. I then received a master's degree in innovation and management at Imperial College in the UK. I love analyzing and brainstorming solutions to economic and political challenges, and especially enjoy applying data science and machine learning techniques to such problems. I also love traveling to new places and am a huge fan of the outdoors, especially the mountains. In my spare time, I enjoy playing cards and going on walks (which can range from casual strolls around the neighbourhood to inter-city treks to intense mountain hiking).</p>

          <p>Want to learn about cities, countries, and cultures you have never heard of before? As a travel and adventure lover, I have been to 38 countries and counting. I love discovering places that are off the beaten track, though I will never say no to a tourist hotspot when given the opportunity. Visit this page to see some of the cool places I have been to. In addition to sharing with you some of the remarkable places and monuments I have come across, my objective is to also give you a bite-sized crash course into the cultural/historical background of each country that I have visited.</p>

          <p>Like many people, I am passionate about political and economic issues. Also like many people, I am frustrated by the lack of healthy political discourse in the US (and around the world). As a personal project, I will be investigating in detail one relevant political, social, or economic topic in depth, and provide a synthesis of my key findings.</p>

          <p>You may be wondering how I managed to not only misspell the word "analysis," but also do so with a nonexistant letter. I chose to deliberately use the turned-A to title this section  because this symbol is frequently used as the universal quantifier in math, which means "for all". I am hopeful that the articles I write here will help people (myself included) better understand other viewpoints and develop more informed stances on political issues. Also, it looks cool.</p>

          <p>I have come to realize that just because I think something is true does not mean my opinion is objective. I will admit it took me some time to come to terms with this regretful realization! In the era of fake news and misleading information, I cannot promise that my articles will be 100% reliable. What I can promise you, however, is that I will thoroughly research all my sources and only post information that I have verified and strongly believe is true. I will do my best to approach these topics with an open mind, and to evaluate and analyze instead of preach or persuade. Finally, I promise to welcome feedback or new information, and to update my conclusions accordingly.</p>
