          <h2>My Coaching and Tutoring Work</h2>
          <p>I believe that education is a critical component of a functioning society, and of a conscientious citizen. It is impossible to bring about effective change in the world without understanding how it works and how social systems are set up. In addition, education allows people to develop advanced skill sets that permit social mobility. I am an experienced math, statistics, economics, and finance teacher, and have long-run ambitions of making quality education accessible to everyone, regardless of income or nationality.</p>

          <h2>My Travel Adventures</h2>
          <p>I am a huge history and geopolitics fan, and love to learn about other countries and their unique culture. As a consequence, I love to travel and to visit new places. I have had the fortune of visiting 38 countries to date. I also love the outdoors and discovering the beauty of nature wherever I am. In this section, I share select pictures from the most interesting places I have visited, and share a short explanation of some interesting historical and cultural tidbits I learned during my travels.</p>

          <h2>Newance</h2>
          <p>Too much of our public discourse is dominated by our instinctive negative reactions to news that conflicts with our worldviews. It is critical for the sake of our unity as a nation and as a species that we learn to give each other the benefit of the doubt when presented with a conflicting viewpoint, and do our utmost to try and understand where other people are coming from. In this section, I share short investigative articles I have written with the hope of sparking meaningful conversation and ultimately determining potential policy insights.</p>
