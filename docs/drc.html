          I visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in May 2024, as part of my East Africa trip with my good
          college friend Allen Liu. We took a cramped night bus from Kigali in Rwanda to the Congolese border town of
          Bukavu. I barely slept, partly due to being squished in the jam-packed vehicle, and partly because the driver
          thought it would be a great idea to blast loud music the entire ride. The Eastern DRC has a reputation for
          being a dangerous region. In fact, the park in North Kivu province that we initially hoped to visit told us
          all tours were shut down due to rebel groups. We therefore arranged to meet a guide, Emery, and to visit the
          (relatively) safe region of South Kivu. Emery was a charming and kind man our age whose conservation research
          took him into areas that were controlled by the M23 rebel group. One of the most interesting aspects of my
          Congo trip was gaining a better understanding of just how complex political struggles in East Africa can be.

        <h2>Bukavu</h2>
        <p>
          Bukavu is a city that straddles the DRC's border with Rwanda. Its population is around 1 million, and it
          definitely was chaotic. I was surprised that, although the Congolese Franc was the official currency, almost
          everyone dealt in US dollars. I had my first first-hand encounter with bribery when leaving crossing the
          border back into Rwanda. A friendly border guard I was chatting with asked me for money to buy a water bottle,
          which I later learned is a regional standard request for a bribe. I do not like giving people money as a
          bribe, but I have nothing against sharing food or water, so I insisted that he take my actual water bottle and
          some Indian snacks my father had given me. Confused and bemused by my apparent naivete, the guard did not take
          my food or water bottle and let me through. I thus avoided having to pay a bribe through enthusiastic
          cluelessness.

          The DRC became independent from Belgium in 1960. In 1965, Joseph-Desire Mobutu led a coup and took control
          of the country. He changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko, and renamed the country as Zaire. He remained in
          power as a dictator until 1997. After the Rwandan Genocide, Mobutu allowed extremist Hutus who perpetuated the
          genocide to seek refuge in Eastern Zaire. This started the First Congo War – also known as Africa’s World War.
          Among others, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and Angola supported the AFDL Congolese rebel group, which sought to
          overthrow Mobutu. The existing regime was supported by the Angolan rebel group UNITA, Sudan, the Rwandan
          Interahamwe, among others. The AFDL emerged victorious, and its leader Laurent-Desire Kabila took control of
          the country, which he renamed to the DRC.

          One year later, Kabila angered his foreign backers by insisting their forces leave his country. Rwanda,
          Burundi, and Uganda were not thrilled at the prospect of losing influence on this resource-rich land, and
          therefore diplomatically and tactfully responded by starting the Second Congo War. This time, the DRC had more
          international support, and its government was not overthrown. However, Kabila was assassinated by his
          bodyguards in 2001 and was replaced by his son Joseph Kabila. Although the Kabilas technically won the war,
          Rwanda and Uganda continue to support rebel groups in the DRC’s East, so the violence has not stopped.

        <h2>Kahuzi-Biega National Park</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest highlight of the DRC was gorilla trekking Kahuzi-Biega National Park. The park is about a 2 hour
          drive outside of Bukavu. When we arrived, the park rangers gave us a safety briefing. They were friendly, but
          sported military-style rifles. They were heavily armed because the northern tip of the park is controlled by
          the M23 rebel forces. They told us that we had to always keep 6 meters distance from the gorillas. We also had
          to wear covid-style masks to make sure we did not get the gorillas sick with any human diseases.

        <h2>Gorilla Trekking</h2>
        <p>
          The Eastern Lowland gorillas are the largest species of gorilla, and endemic to Eastern Congo. Apparently,
          their social structure is very patriarchal. Adult males called “silverbacks” lead harems that include however
          many females they can win from other males, and their children. We bushwhacked with a guide for about an hour
          in a circular journey around the camp until we found a group of gorillas. For almost an hour, we observed 2-3
          baby and juvenile gorillas, 2-3 female mother gorillas, and a massive male silverback. I was surprised at how
          the gorillas’ facial expressions and eating habits resembled our own.

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          Although the roads in Bukavu were paved, the highway toward Kahuzi Park soon turned into a dirt road. On our
          return journey, our car got a flat tire. Since it was Sunday, everything was shut down in this deeply
          Christian nation. Emery went to find someone to replace the tire, leaving Allen and me in the car. We were
          quickly surrounded by two dozen Congolese children, who eyed our guide’s bag of bananas visible in the
          backseat. Two mischievous boys kept trying to open the car doors, but I refused to give them food since the
          bananas weren’t mine. When Emery returned, he berated the children but gave them some bananas. I remembered I
          had cookies and madeleine snacks in my backpack, though not enough for everyone. The guide assured me the kids
          would appreciate even a small amount, so I ended up handing out one Pepito cookie and half a madeleine to each
          child. The kids were excited and all held out their hands to receive their share. I was distraught that one
          could get so ecstatic over barely a mouthful of food. No matter how much food insecurity the West faces,
          hunger in the Congo is on another level.
