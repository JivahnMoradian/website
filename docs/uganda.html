          I visited Uganda in May 2024, as part of my East Africa trip with my good college friend Allen Liu. We took
          a 10-hour night bus from Kigali in Rwanda to Kampala in Uganda. The bus was modern, and we had space, but
          sleep was made difficult by the driver’s decision to blast gospel music THE ENTIRE JOURNEY. It was very
          beautiful at the start, but after 5 hours of hearing a choir joyously singing the same tune, I was praying
          that Jesus would shut down the audio. We spent a few days in Kampala and went on a day trip to the nearby city
          of Entebbe.

        <h2>Kampala</h2>
        <p>
          Kampala is Uganda’s large and very chaotic capital city. Navigation was quite easy because most people spoke
          English and were helpful. Motorcycle taxis and cars flood the streets, and unlike in Rwanda, many passengers
          do not wear helmets. We passed by the old taxi station which was a massive open-air parking lot jam-packed
          with share taxi vans. In one part of the city, every single street pole was plastered with posters from
          various Ugandan “doctors” advertising their practices. I did not know that your run of the mill Ugandan street
          doctor can “catch thieves by bees” or perform penis enlargement, but clearly these are solutions worth
          advertising.

          Uganda is a multi-ethnic country, and no one group makes up a majority of the population. It gained its
          independence from the UK in 1962 and became a kingdom. In 1966, the socialist Milton Obote gained power in a
          coup d’etat and abolished the kingdoms. His corruption and violation of civil and human rights made him
          unpopular, and in 1971 the commander of the Ugandan military Idi Amin overthrew him. Idi Amin set up a
          dictatorial regime that killed hundreds of thousands of Ugandans. In 1972, he expelled over 20,000 members of
          Uganda’s wealthy and influential South Asian community, which tanked the nation’s economy.

          In 1978, border tensions led to the Uganda-Tanzania War. Uganda was supported by Libya and the Palestinian
          Liberation Organization, whereas Tanzania fought alongside the Uganda National Liberation Front rebel group.
          Tanzania emerged victorious in 1979. Idi Amin fled the country, and the familiar face of Milton Obote seized
          power once again. However, he did not manage to unite the nation for long. In 1980, Obote’s previous ally
          Yoweri Museveni rebelled, starting the Ugandan Bush War. Conflict would last until 1986, when Museveni emerged
          victorious. Despite Uganda being a democracy on the surface, Museveni has remained in power since then. Unlike
          in Rwanda, however, several Ugandans we met felt free to sternly criticize their leader.

        <h2>Kasubi Tombs</h2>
        <p>
          In Kampala, we visited the Kasubi Tombs, where four Bagandan kabakas (kings) are buried. The Kingdom of
          Buganda is a traditional kingdom that falls within Uganda’s borders. It is led by a king, Muwenda Mutebi II,
          who lacks official political power, but exercises massive influence over ethnic Bagandans, who make up 16.5%
          of Uganda’s population. These massive structures are built entirely with natural materials like wood and
          thatch. Our tour guide, who revealed that he was a Bugandan prince, helped clear up our confusion with the
          terminology: the Bugandan kingdom is contained within Uganda (the country); its people are Bagandan, and speak
          Luganda.

        <h2>Gaddafi Mosque</h2>
        <p>
          We had the good fortune of getting a tour of the Ugandan National Mosque, also known as the Gaddafi Mosque.
          Its construction was initiated by Idi Amin in the 1970s, but all progress halted after he was deposed.
          However, in 2001, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya funded it, and it was completed in 2007. A kind lady called Fatima
          gave us a tour of the mosque’s interior, and led us up the minaret, which offered a stunning view of the city.

        <h2>Entebbe - Aero Beach</h2>
        <p>
          In Entebbe, we visited Aero Beach – an airplane cemetery on the shores of Lake Victoria. In 1976, two
          Palestinians and two Germans hijacked Air France Flight 139 that was heading from Tel Aviv to Paris. Idi Amin
          let them land and keep their hostages in Entebbe. The Israeli secret service, Mossad, launched Operation
          Thunderbolt – a daring raid in which 100 commandos stormed the compound the captives were held in, killed 45
          Ugandan soldiers, and rescued 102 hostages. Idi Amin was not thrilled. Because Kenya supported Israel and
          allowed the Mossad force to refuel there, the Ugandan military retaliated by killing 245 Kenyans who lived in
          Uganda, and expelling thousands more. Surprisingly, the hijacked Air France plane was not in the park – the
          largest plane was a British Air Tour passenger jet.
