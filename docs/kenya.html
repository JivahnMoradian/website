          I visited Kenya in June 2024, as part of my East Africa trip with my good college friend Allen Liu. We made
          the mistake of taking a night bus from Kampala in Uganda to Nairobi in Kenya. The bus was supposed to take 12
          hours, but due to an engine issue and traffic, the journey took us 17 hours in total. The people we spoke to
          in Rwanda and in the DRC viewed Kenya as an advanced tech hub – and for good reason, as Kenya created the
          MPESA mobile money transfer system that is used across the region. Several people called it the United States
          of Africa. However, these same people also told us that the city is not very safe, so we remained cautious.

        <h2>Nairobi</h2>
        <p>
          Nairobi is a large and cosmopolitan city, and East Africa’s financial center. The city felt extremely
          developed and modern, though I noticed several large slums on its outskirts. It is surrounded by several
          forests and even a national park. We visited both the Kenya National Museum, and the Nairobi Safari Walk, a
          path in Nairobi National Park that lets you see many wild animals you normally could only see on a safari,
          such as rhinos and leopards. In both cases, we had to register with the Kenyan e-citizen platform to buy
          tickets. I am sure it would have been easy if we had access to MPESA and were already registered; however
          Kenya’s technology was confusing and time-consuming for clueless foreigners like us.

          Kenya is home to many ethnic and cultural groups, including the Kikuyu, the Luo, the Luhya, the Kalenjin, the
          Kamba, and the Masai. Although many people speak Swahili, this language is less universal than in Tanzania,
          which might explain why there seem to be more tensions between Kenya’s ethnic groups than there are in
          Tanzania. Kenya was colonized in 1895 by Britain and became known as the East Africa Protectorate. During the
          1950s, several groups united to start the violent Mau Mau uprising, which took up arms against the British
          colonial rulers. Although the rebellion was unsuccessful, and the British killed thousands of Kenyans, it put
          additional strain on Britain’s resources.

          Kenya gained independence in 1963. Its first leader was Jomo Kenyatta. Kenyatta pursued a capitalist and
          pro-Western economic policy that helped the country develop faster than many of its peers in the region.
          However, he installed a single party state and was accused of favoring his own ethnic group (the Kikuyu) over
          many others. When Kenyatta died in 1978, his vice-president Daniel Arap Moi took power, and ruled until 2002.
          Moi passed a constitutional amendment banning other political parties, though this was repealed a decade
          later. He was also accused of significant corruption. Since Moi, Kenya has had three other presidents. Its
          current leader, William Ruto, saw his popularity plummet following public protests to a tax bill he attempted
          to pass a few weeks after I visited Kenya.

        <h2>Plane in Uhuru Park</h2>
        <p>
          One of Nairobi’s highlights is Uhuru Park, a spacious park near the city center. The park is fenced off and
          only has two entrances, both of which have security guards check visitors’ bags before allowing them to enter.
          The park has several models of animals that are native to Kenya. Allen and I were surprised to see a massive
          passenger plane in the middle of the park. A few weeks after we left Kenya, the government tried to pass a
          controversial finance bill that would raise taxes on many everyday items. Massive protests led to the bill
          being rejected. I learned that the plane we saw was torched during the protests. Had we arrived in Kenya just
          a few weeks later, we would have missed this interesting feature entirely.

        <h2>Masai Mara National Park - Lions</h2>
        <p>
          The highlight of our trip was going on a 3-day safari to the Masai Mara park. The Masai Mara borders the
          Serengeti, which is in Tanzania. Almost all the tourists we saw on the safari were foreigners – sadly, it
          seems that few Kenyans can afford to go on such ventures, even though the park fees are much lower for locals.
          I was surprised how comfortable the animals were around the jeeps. You would think that most wild animals
          would consider a noisy 2-ton jeep crowded with tourists as either a threat or a treat. However, almost all the
          animals we saw completely ignored us. In fact, some of the lions we encountered used our jeep as a makeshift
          beach umbrella and napped in the shade our vehicle created. We also encountered a lazy cheetah who remained
          nearly motionless for over 90 minutes before eventually walking off into the sunset.

        <h2>Masai Mara National Park - Elephants</h2>
        <p>
          The Masai Mara is home to the world’s largest animal migration. Every year, around 1.7 million wildebeest and
          250,000 zebras migrate between the Ngorongoro Crater in the Tanzanian Serengeti and the Kenyan Masai Mara. The
          lions and crocodiles in the Masai Mara essentially view the Great Migration as a free buffet delivered right
          to their door – and they don’t even have to subscribe to Uber Eats! In addition to the lions and cheetah, we
          also saw many elephants, gazelles, impalas, antelopes, elands, hippopotami, baboons, giraffes, and even two
          crocodiles. For someone who grew up in a city, it was amazing to see so many animals in the wild and
          unconstrained by cages or fences.
