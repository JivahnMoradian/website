          I visited Uzbekistan in August 2023, as part of my Central Asia trip with my good friend from college Allen
          Liu. I visited three cities with Allen (Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara), then I toured Khiva, Urgench,
          Nukus, and Moynaq in the nation’s northeast on my own. Uzbekistan is a desert country with a rich cultural
          history, that remains relatively undiscovered by Western tourists. Because we visited during the scorching
          summer, there were even fewer tourists than usual. I was surprised that almost all cars were white Chevrolets.
          I suspect that the white color reflects sunlight and hides desert dust that no doubt gradually accumulates on
          them over time. A highlight of my trip was seeing Uzbekistan’s Zoroastrian heritage – an old Iranian religion
          that was dominant in the region before the spread of Islam, and that of my father’s side of the family. Many
          mosques in Uzbekistan used to be Zoroastrian fire temples, and it was fascinating to see this religion’s
          cultural and architectural vestiges. I also visited the Avesta Museum in Urgench, and really enjoyed talking
          with its kind manager, who patiently showed me Uzbekistan’s Zoroastrian history despite him not speaking
          English, and me neither speaking Russian nor Uzbek.

        <h2>Tashkent, Samarkand, and Bukhara</h2>
        <p>
          Tashkent is Uzbekistan’s capital and largest city, located right next to the border with Kazakhstan. It sports
          an interesting mixture of modern-looking buildings and historic Uzbek architecture. Samarkand is Uzbekistan’s
          third largest city, its tourist hub, and the ancient capital of the Timurid Empire. It is a stunning city,
          with some of the most beautiful architecture I have ever seen. I have described it to friends as being like
          Paris or Rome, but at a third of the price and a quarter of the tourists. Bukhara is Uzbekistan’s seventh
          largest city than Samarkand, and is slightly less touristic, but consequently feels even more authentic. On
          top of its many mosques and madrasas, the Ark of Bukhara is an impressive fortress that dominates the city.
          Uzbekistan’s excellent train system connects these three cities via a high-speed rail line, so it was easy to
          get from one to another.

          Uzbekistan, like its Central Asian neighbors, succumbed to the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. As the
          Mongol Empire split up, Amir Timur took control of the region. Because he was not a direct descendant of
          Genghis Khan, Timur could not call himself a khan, so he initially ruled through a puppet leader. He started
          the Timurid Empire, which he led between 1370 and 1405. Uzbekistan idolizes Timur for his military genius – he
          was an undefeated general, and rapidly expanded his empire’s size. He was a brilliant strategist who won
          victory through unorthodox means. He managed to take over the Delhi Sultanate by using camels loaded with hay
          that he set on fire as his frontline soldiers. The blazing camels scared the defendants’ war elephants and
          caused them to panic, disrupting their defensive positions. However, outside of Central Asia, Timur is
          remembered for the brutality and cruelty of his forces, which slaughtered millions of people. After the
          Timurid Empire, the region was controlled by the Bukharan, Khivan, and Kokand Khanates, which lasted until the
          Russian Empire gradually took them over in the late 1800s and early 1900s. After the Russian Revolution of
          1917, Uzbekistan became part of the Soviet Union.

          After gaining independence from the USSR in 1991, Uzbekistan was ruled by Islam Karimov. Karimov ruled
          Uzbekistan as an autocrat, and his regime committed many human rights abuses. Prominent among these is the
          2005 Andijan Massacre, where the Uzbek National Security Service slaughtered hundreds of people protesting the
          arrests of two dozen local businessmen. Like his Kazakh compatriot Nursultan Nazarbayev, Karimov’s cult of
          personality remains visible in Uzbekistan’s National Museum, where a whole exhibit is dedicated to showing his
          shaking hands with world leaders. After Karimov’s death in 2016, Shavkat Mirziyoyev became president. Although
          Mirziyoyev retains many of Karimov’s autocratic tendencies, he has opened Uzbekistan towards the outside world
          and liberalized the country through various policies including abolishing the death penalty. He also formally
          changed the Uzbek alphabet to follow a Latin script, instead of the Cyrillic script that was mandated during
          the Soviet period. This makes Uzbekistan slightly easier to navigate than its neighbors in Central Asia for
          Western tourists.

        <h2>Samarkand's Registan</h2>
        <p>
          Uzbekistan’s most famous touristic location is Samarkand’s Registan. This central square is surrounded by
          three massive madrasas, each of which is built in Uzbekistan’s ornate architectural style. Although Westerners
          usually associate madrasas with religious institutions, the term simply means school, and Samarkand’s madrasas
          also taught political officials, mathematicians, and lawyers. One of these buildings was built by Ulug Beg, a
          sultan who ruled the Timurid Empire between 1447 and 1449. He was most remembered for being a brilliant
          astronomer and mathematician, who made significant advances in trigonometry and built a cutting-edge (for its
          time) observatory that made Samarkand a center of science and astronomy. Schools in the West make it seem like
          all major scientific advancements originated in Europe; it was eye-opening to realize just how advanced 15th
          century Uzbek science and astronomy was.

        <h2>Khiva Historic Walled City</h2>
        <p>
          The historic town of Khiva is in Uzbekistan’s northwest. Along with Bukhara, it used the be the center of
          Central Asia’s slave trade, which was only abolished after the Russian Empire’s invasion of the region in 1873
          prompted a slave rebellion. Khiva’s walled city center (called the Itchan Kala) somehow managed to retain its
          historic architecture despite a century of Russian and Soviet rule, and today the entire center is a UNESCO
          World Heritage site. The city has countless mosques, mausoleums, and madrasahs that are built in classic Uzbek
          style, and the 44m tall Islam Khoja minaret offers a stunning view of the entire city. Because Khiva is far
          away from Uzbekistan’s capital (though still easily accessible by night train), it attracts relatively few
          tourists and feels extremely authentic.

        <h2>Moynaq Ship Cemetary</h2>
        <p>
          The Aral Sea used to be the world’s third largest lake. Starting in the 1960s, the Soviet Union began
          intensively cultivating cotton in Central Asia and diverted the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers that fed into
          the Aral Sea. Over the next few decades, the Aral Sea shrunk to 10% of its original surface area, in one of
          the world’s worst environmental disasters. This had a devastating effect on the local economy – the town of
          Moynaq used to be one of the largest contributors to the USSR’s fishing industry, but today this fleet of
          once-proud ships lies as a skeletal remnant of its former glory. To get to the Aral Sea, I had to take a night
          train from Samarkand to Nukus, which was surprisingly comfortable. From here, the tour guide picked me up and
          we drove for three hours to Moynaq. Then, we had to drive for four hours over the Aralkum Desert – the old
          seabed of the dried-up lake – until we finally reached what is left of the sea. Driving over the flat lakebed
          for hours was unsettling, and made realize just how serious an ecological disaster this was.
